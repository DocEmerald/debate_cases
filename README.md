 The list of points, rebuttals, and the example case will be in bullet points. This makes for easier reading while delivering a speech. 
 
 Cases are organized by year because evidence can change and be outdated.
 
 Why Markdown?
 Markdown is a simple markup language very similar to normal text. This way text formatting will be simple.
