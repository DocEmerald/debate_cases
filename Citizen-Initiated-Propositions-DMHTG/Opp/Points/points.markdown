1. CIP's give voters a voice in creating new laws
   1. **Reasoning:** they give voters power to make laws that matter to them, and will improve everyone's lives.
   2. **Evidence:**
      1. according to the Los Angeles Times in 2019, Californians have passed initiatives that ended gerrymandering by shifting redistricting to citizen commissions and busted partisan gridlock by requiring only a simple majority vote on budgets. Initiatives have also enacted far-reaching environmental laws to protect the coast and address climate change.
      2. If approved by voters, California homeowners who are 55 or older can purchase a new home and keep their property tax payment at the same level or a reduced rate — depending on the value of the new house. This expands a long-standing program that is available only in a few counties. The impact is clear: Older Californians who might otherwise be reluctant to change homes and pay higher property taxes would receive a new break. --> proposition 19
      3. European Citizens Initiative (ECI) is a European Union CIP mechanism, thats stated goal is to enable “EU citizens to participate directly in the development of EU policies.” The ECI has passed a number of beneficial initiatives, such as
         4. Right2Water, an initiative that aimed to guarantee safe drinking water for all citizens of the European Union
         5. Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides, banned glyphosate, a pesticide that has been classified by the World Health Organization as probably causing cancer in humans.
      1. Several active ECI initiatives:
         1. Voters without Borders -- full political rights for EU citizens and aims to give universal suffrage
         2. Proposition to increase regulation of vaping.
    1. **Impact:** CIP’s clearly benefit our voters and our democracy, because they know what they want and CIP’s allow them to get it done. They don’t have to go through the bureaucracy of going to Congress and can make their voice heard.
2. CIP's are purely from the people, so they are free from corruption and outside influence
3. CIP's result in higher voter turnout and better informed citizens.
4. CIP's go through a well managed process that verifies that they are good and organized.
5. Citizens know the issues better than legislators, so CIP's will address them more effectively.
   1. Reasoning: Oftentimes, people know the problems in their own communities, much better than any legislators could. Legislators who are extremely rich compared to the average citizens do not understand the circumstances that other people are going through. They do not see everyone’s perspectives which is why the people need to be able to initiate propositions. 
6. CIP's are well evaluated
   1. **Reasoning:** The process citizen initiated propositions have to go through is very well managed and verifies that the propositions are very good and organized. In addition almost half of the states with an initiative process give the legislature the ability to review the initiatives, which greatly reduces the chance of initiatives being taken advantage of or used for purely personal gains.
