1. CIP's give voters a voice in creating new laws
   1. **Reasoning:** they give voters power to make laws that matter to them, and will improve everyone's lives.
   2. **Evidence:**
      1. according to the Los Angeles Times in 2019, Californians have passed initiatives that ended gerrymandering by shifting redistricting to citizen commissions and busted partisan gridlock by requiring only a simple majority vote on budgets. Initiatives have also enacted far-reaching environmental laws to protect the coast and address climate change.
2. CIP's are purely from the people, so they are free from corruption and outside influence
3. CIP's result in higher voter turnout and better informed citizens.
4. CIP's go through a well managed process that verifies that they are good and organized.
5. Citizens know the issues better than legislators, so CIP's will address them more effectively.
   1. Reasoning: Oftentimes, people know the problems in their own communities, much better than any legislators could. Legislators who are extremely rich compared to the average citizens do not understand the circumstances that other people are going through. They do not see everyoneâ€™s perspectives which is why the people need to be able to initiate propositions. 
6. CIP's are well evaluated
   1. **Reasoning:** The process citizen initiated propositions have to go through is very well managed and verifies that the propositions are very good and organized. In addition almost half of the states with an initiative process give the legislature the ability to review the initiatives, which greatly reduces the chance of initiatives being taken advantage of or used for purely personal gains.
