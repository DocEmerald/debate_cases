4. Presence has led to better women's rights
   1. Reasoning:
   2. **Evidence:** 
      1. Brookings states that in areas of Afghanistan that HAVE already been conquered by the Taliban, 80% of Afghan women are experiencing domestic violence. In these areas, 50% of women and 95% of girls have been jailed for trying to defend their rights. 
      2. Since US-Taliban negotiations began in early 2019, women’s rights activists and other Afghans have raised concerns about Taliban restrictions on women’s rights. Amina Mohammed from the United Nations expressed that “Under the Taliban, women and girls were denied schooling, health care and protection from extreme violence, but the past 18 years have seen significant progress.”
