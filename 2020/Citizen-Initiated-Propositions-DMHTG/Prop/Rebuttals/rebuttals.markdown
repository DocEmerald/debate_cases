1. Gives citizens a chance to pass a law that most politicians wouldn’t:

    Like our 2nd point states, citizens don’t really understand fully how complex politics really are. A representative would only do what’s best for a certain state or county, rather than a citizen who would want what’s best for the individual. If politicians wont pass the law, there was probably a problem with it in the first place. 

2. Have been good citizen-passed propositions

    There have been countless bad propositions out there, and while everyone makes mistakes, the people have not made any improvement in being educated in politics before voting in propositions. And the mistakes made by the citizens would have been easily avoided if it were done by representatives or appointed officials. Like our first speaker mentioned, there were several propositions that do more harm than benefits. (state an example like prop 23)

3. Citizens know the problems better than legislators
   1. For example, the current US government relies on a representative government that VOTES ON THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. Citizens can vote for whatever representative will help solve their problems and will not vote for an official if they passed unfair laws in the past. On top of that, the people are still able to voice their opinions by protesting, signing petitions, communicating with congress, and more. 
   2. Citizens can still propose uniformed propositions:
   > An example of one of these uninformed propositions is Prop 23. If you were to vote yes for this proposition, you are saying you want one nurse or physician during treatment which is going to reduce service to others who need help at the same time. On the surface this seems good but this will shut down clinics across California and risk the lives of 80,000 patients. It also REFUSES to treat patients based on payment source and will cost the state and local government millions of dollars every single year. Even the American Nurses Association is against this proposition, yet it’s still being put on the ballot for consideration. Furthermore, this is putting an extra burden on the essential workers for covid that will be taken away from this proposition. 
   > Another example, prop. 21 will make California's housing crisis worse. It undermines the strongest statewide rent control law in the nation, costs jobs, reduces home values, stops new housing from being built, and eliminates homeowner protections while providing no protections for renters, seniors, veterans or the disabled. 

4. Process is fair
   1. How is it fair if the rich have an advantage? 

5. Inclusive to All/Minorities
   1. While direct democracy does give citizens a say in the policies and laws of their state, it can also be used by businesses and the wealthy to pass policy goals. Initiatives can also lead to bad policy if voters do not research the measure or misunderstand the law. In addition, polling stations are placed farther away from poorer neighborhoods. Because of this, low income families can’t afford to vote because they can’t miss an hour of work.

6. Greater voter turnout
   1. In 2016’s California Presidential primary, 48 percent of registered voters turned out to vote, a drop of 10 points from 2008 – the last Presidential primary featuring two competitive, open contests. Even compared to 2000 – the next most previous Presidential primary with two open (but less competitive) primaries – turnout in 2016 was down about 6 points. This means that even as more citizen initiated propositions are being put on the ballot, voter turnout is still low.
   2. In about citizens being uninformed redirectly refutes that point. Look to the Hoover Institute which explains that, “Even though voter registration is at all-time highs, voters appear to be becoming less interested in participating in politics. What is important is that we are relying on a less engaged – and possibly more partisan and extreme – electorate to make major policy decisions.  We cannot expect voters to educate themselves on the issues they are to vote on if they aren’t interested in voting in the first place.”

7. CIP are democratic

8. Verification Process
   1. Opp said that the Secretary of State will review laws for clarity and correct legal language. However, according to California’s Statewide Initiative Guide, having the Secretary review the law is optional and not mandatory.
   2. Plus, the verification process only verifies the language not the actual content.
